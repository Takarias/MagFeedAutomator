2. Run MagFeedAutomator.exe
3. Follow setup prompts
4. Watch cat videos while your Mag gets fed

INSTALLATION
--------------------

As portable software, there is no installation! Simply unpack the release
.zip archive and put it wherever is most convenient for you.

HOW TO USE
--------------------

I made every effort I could to make this tool as as simple to use as possible,
but since it works with a very quirky old game, there are some caveats to keep
in mind when using it.

Before you launch the tool, ensure that:
- PSO CANNOT be running under a compatibility mode for this took to work. If
	being run in a compatibility mode, PSO will not accept inputs from this tool!
- In PSO, under Menu > Options > Function Key Setting, the function keys must be
	set to "Menu Shortcuts"
- You are on the character you intend to use for this stretch of feeding.
	- Note: For the purposes of this readme, a 'feed' is defined as a stretch of
		feeding a single item, such as 363 Dimates
- Your inventory contains nothing but the Mag you intend to feed and enough
	Meseta to complete the feed (Android traps can be safely ignored)
- Your character is standing in front of the Tools (items) shop and is able to
	access it. This can be easily confirmed by accessing the shop and then 
	backing out.

Once situated, launch the tool and follow the prompts. If you made an error in
your selections or need to exit the tool for any reason, find the icon in your
system tray, right click it, and select "Exit."

Once set up, the tool will minimize to the system tray. You are free to use your
computer for almost anything you want. Exceptions include anything that will
cause PSO to crash (and if you play PSO, you're familiar with this lol), and
specific programs that somehow block focus switching. I have only found Chatty
(Twitch chat client) to have caused this error so far, but I can't test
everything. The tool will interrupt whatever you are doing every 3.5 minutes to
initiate a new feed cycle.

Thank you for using MagTestAutomator!

DISCLAIMER
--------------------

I have done my best to adequately test this tool. If, however, you find
something that doesn't seem to be working quite right, or you're willing to fix
my garbage (but functional!) code, feel free to reach out to me at
twitch.tv/Takarias, @Takarias on Twitter, or Takarias#4610 on Discord.
